The Browser Webpack TypeScript React App Template offers a complete foundation for developing modern browser-based applications with TypeScript, React, and Webpack. Featuring pre-configured setups for React components, TypeScript, and asset optimization, this template streamlines your development workflow while ensuring clean and maintainable code. It’s designed to help developers start coding quickly with all the necessary tools integrated, including ESLint, Prettier, and Stylelint for code quality and consistency.

## What is Browser Webpack TypeScript React App Template?

The Browser Webpack TypeScript React App Template is a carefully designed template that accelerates frontend development by providing a pre-configured environment for building React applications with TypeScript. It leverages Webpack to handle bundling, transpilation, and asset management, making it a powerful starting point for creating efficient and scalable browser applications.

This template comes with built-in configurations for TypeScript, ensuring seamless compilation of JSX and TSX files, and it fully integrates ESLint for React and TypeScript linting, Prettier for automatic code formatting, and Stylelint for enforcing CSS and SCSS styling standards. Additionally, it supports Webpack plugins for optimizing HTML, CSS, images, and other assets, helping maintain high performance and streamlined workflows.

With support for Webpack DevServer and hot module replacement, you can create a smooth development experience, minimizing downtime and speeding up iterations. The template also includes a Makefile that simplifies command-line operations, from starting the development server to running code checks and preparing for production deployment.

This is my personal GitHub profile, where you’ll find public documentation and sample repositories for proprietary packages and templates from Premierstacks. These public repositories are designed to give you an overview of the best practices and high-quality code I follow in all my projects.

## What is Premierstacks

[https://gitub.com/premierstacks](https://gitub.com/premierstacks)

Premierstacks is a collection of exclusive, proprietary stacks and templates for PHP, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Laravel. It was created to address the common pain points developers face with many open-source projects—quality, consistency, and maintainability. With Premierstacks, you get high-quality tools built with strict attention to detail, designed to help you build and maintain better projects, faster.

## Why Premierstacks?

I created Premierstacks because I wasn’t satisfied with the quality of many open-source projects. Maintaining high-quality code and ensuring long-term reliability is challenging when you’re not earning from the product. When you pay for something, it means the creator truly cares about its success and is committed to delivering the best possible outcome.

Like Apple’s approach with their closed ecosystem, I believe that true excellence can only be achieved when every detail is under your control. That’s why Premierstacks is proprietary software—it's not just about providing solutions; it’s about ensuring those solutions meet the highest standards.
